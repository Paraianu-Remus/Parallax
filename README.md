Parallax Scrolling describes a trend in web design. Websites with parallax scrolling can be controlled using the scroll function. If the user scrolls down, the elements of the website move at different speeds.
A background image moves slowly, while images or graphic elements move faster in the foreground. This so-called "parallax effect" gives the user an impression of depth - the website appears like a 3D animation, which is continued by scrolling downwards.
