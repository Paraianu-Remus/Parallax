      <h2>Parallax Scrolling Effects</h2>
      <p>
        Parallax Scrolling describes a trend in web design. Websites with
        parallax scrolling can be controlled using the scroll function. If the
        user scrolls down, the elements of the website move at different speeds.
        A background image moves slowly, while images or graphic elements move
        faster in the foreground.<br /><br />This so-called "parallax effect"
        gives the user an impression of depth - the website appears like a 3D
        animation, which is continued by scrolling downwards. This operating
        concept is particularly suitable for storytelling, as the consumption of
        content can be supported by scroll effects, animations and
        superimpositions. Synonyms for Parallax Scrolling in web design are
        Parallax Website, Scrolling Website and Parallax Web Design.

      <h3>General Information</h3>
      <p>
        Parallax Scrolling works with the so-called movement parallax. When an
        observer moves parallel to two objects, the objects appear to move at
        different speeds. The closer object seems to move faster, the farther
        away object seems to move slower. This psychological effect creates a
        special depth perception for the observer, as the light reflections of
        the near object hit the retina more quickly. The human brain processes
        these stimuli in such a way that the depicted space is perceived as in
        3D.<br /><br />The effect of the parallax of motion is relevant in
        geometry, astronomy, photography and metrology. In 2D video games,
        parallax is used to create depth and give orientation to the player. For
        some years now, the Parallax scrolling effect has also been used in web
        design. The aim is to improve the acceptance of the information
        presented and to make use of the website more interactive. Users should
        remember the information on the presentation and should feel "joy of
        use" when operating the website.
      </p>
      <h3>How it works</h3>
      <p>
        The parallax motion can be generated on websites in different ways. As a
        rule, background images and picture elements are used in the foreground
        in such a way that the viewer moves through the scenery with the scroll
        function. The overall picture or the visible above the fold area is the
        fixed point - also known as viewport - for the viewer: The website moves
        from this fixed point to a certain extent, while individual elements
        move faster and slower. These movements are caused by slides, fade out,
        fade in and fixed elements such as text or graphics, which are
        constantly loaded by the so-called HTML reflow. The arrangement of the
        partially animated elements on the motion parallax results in a dynamic
        appearance of the contents: The user "experiences" the contents because
        they move horizontally.<br /><br />The website itself is often
        conceptually a single page website or One Pager: source code, texts,
        images, images, CSS and scripts can be found in a document stored on a
        server. With selectors, CSS tags and script calls the effects are
        triggered after they have been initiated by a scrolling movement by the
        user. Increased use of scripts, detailed graphics, high-resolution
        images or complex rendering can increase the loading time of the
        content. Therefore, a discreet use of the effects and a slim source code
        are recommended. Ideally, parallax scrolling is part of the entire
        website concept, which can also be a multi-page website if used in a
        targeted way.
